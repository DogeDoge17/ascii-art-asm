 turn an epic bmp into epic characters
 only works with bitmaps (*.bmp) because its not compressed and ts is assembly. the input image should be like squished because characters are tall. you can make the input image big if you want. the bitmap should have a 24bit color. Only works on windows because of all the direct windows api calls (wine compatible).
